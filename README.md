# UemploymentANALYSIS_MACHINE_LEARNING

Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. 
We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project

The unemployment rate is calculated based on a particular region, so to analyze unemployment I will be using an unemployment dataset of India. 
The dataset I’m using here contains data on India’s unemployment rate during Covid-19.
